# mjpeg_webserver

Web server that can serve JPEG's from a camera or an AVI file.

This was an old project started in 2006 or so. The original idea
was to be able to serve out AVI video files as JPEGs. This allowed
the emulation of expensive security cameras from a PC. It was later
expanded to get video from webcams, along with supporting serving
normal files, CGIs, and plugins.
